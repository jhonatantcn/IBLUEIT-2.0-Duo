%% HEADERS %%
%The first 2 lines above are headers. Never remove them!
%StageId = Stage Identification (min: 1)
%Phase = Phase Identification (min: 1, max: 4)
%Level = Level Identification (min: 1)
%ObjectSpeedFactor = Controls the objects speed (min: 1.0. max: 3.0)
%Increment = Incremental value that controls player performance during a level (min: 0.0 max: 1.0)
%Up Threshold = Number of successes required to increase performance height/sizes by 'Increment' during a level (min: 0.0 max: 5.0)
%Down Threshold = Number of failures required to decrease performance height/sizes by 'Increment' during a level (min: 0.0 max: 5.0)
%Loops = Number of times to repeat a script (min: 1, max: 99)

%% COMMANDS %% 
%Commands always after the headers
%Template: ObjectType;DifficultyFactor;PositionYFactor;PositionXSpacing;
%ObjectType = Object to spawn (Target | Obstacle | Relax)
%DifficultyFactor => Modifies Height/Size (min: 0.0, max: 1.0)
%PositionYFactor = Where the object should be spawned (AIR = 1, WATER = -1)
%PositionXSpacing = Distance from the last spawned object in unity's metric unit
%Relax command does not use DifficultyFactor and PositionYFactor
